## Overview

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - After completing the other challenges, this was pretty easy to pull off. I realise that, using grid, the alignment of the sections in the view is simpler. After that, it all comes down to stylishing the elements. I thing the finished layout is ok compared from the given one.
